The dedication and resilience of these healthcare workers are truly commendable. As for Biden, it seems that his previous debate claims are causing difficulties for him, especially with the ongoing GOP investigations. It emphasizes the importance of politicians being accountable for their statements and actions, as they can come back to haunt them in the future.", "chickenGPT": "\u6709\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u9752\u86d9\u53eb\u9e21\u513f\u6bcf\u5929\u5341\u70b9\u51c6\u65f6\u5403\u836f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u9e21\u513f\u5374\u5fd8\u4e86\u3002\u9752\u86d9\u751f\u6c14\u5730\u95ee\u9053\uff1a\"\u9e21\u513f\uff0c\u4f60\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6ca1\u6709\u5403\u836f\uff1f\" \u9e21\u513f\u72b9\u8c6b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f9e\u6da9\u5730\u8bf4\uff1a\"\u563f\u563f\uff0c\u8ddf\u4f60\u8bf4\u4e2a\u79d8\u5bc6\uff0c\u6211\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u732b\uff01\u5f53\u7136\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5403\u86d9\u836f\u5566\uff01\ud83d\ude3a\" \u9752\u86d9\u751f\u6c14\u5730\u76ef\u4f4f\u9e21\u513f\uff1a\"\u4f60\u8fd9\u662f\u732b\u8fd8\u662f\u9e21\u554a\uff1f\u522b\u9017\u6211\u4e86\uff01\" \ud83d\udc38\ud83d\udc14 \u9e21\u513f\u8c03\u76ae\u5730\u7b11\u4e86\u8d77\u6765\uff1a\"\u54c8\u54c8\uff0c\u6211\u9a97\u4f60\u7684\u5440\uff01\u90a3\u53ea\u662f\u6211\u5f00\u73a9\u7b11\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u6211\u662f\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u3002\u771f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u4e0b\u6b21\u4e00\u5b9a\u8bb0\u5f97\u5403\u836f\uff01\ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\" \u9752\u86d9\u53f9\u4e86\u53e3\u6c14\uff0c\u6447\u6447\u5934\uff1a\"\u7b97\u4e86\u7b97\u4e86\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4f60\u6ca1\u4e8b\u5c31\u597d\uff01\u4e0b\u6b21\u53ef\u522b\u518d\u5fd8\u4e86\u54e6\uff01\" \ud83d\udc38\ud83d\udc14\n\nTranslation:\nOne day, the frog asked the chicken to take its medicine at 10 o'clock every day, but the chicken forgot.
