But one night, the chick forgot. The frog, worried, hopped into the chick's room and sang, \"10 PM! \ud83d\udc8a Time for your meds!\" The chick, startled, jumped up and exclaimed, \"Oh no! I forgot!\" The frog sighed and said, \"Well, it's a holiday today, so you can take it at 11 PM.\" The chick smiled and gave the frog a hug. \"Thanks, froggy! You saved me!\""}
