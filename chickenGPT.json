But one day, the chick \ud83d\udc24 forgot. The next morning, the frog \ud83d\udc38 asked the chick \ud83d\udc24, \"Did you take your medicine last night?\" The chick \ud83d\udc24 replied, \"Oops, I forgot! But I did take a bath instead.\" The frog \ud83d\udc38 was confused and asked, \"How does that help?\" The chick \ud83d\udc24 replied, \"Well, at least I'm clean and ready for the doctor!\" \ud83e\udd23"}
