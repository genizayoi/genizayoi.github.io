The frog hops over to the chick's bedside and croaks, \"Hey, it's 10 PM! Time for your meds!\" The chick looks up at the frog with wide eyes and says, \"Oh no! I forgot! Where are they?\" The frog looks at the chick and says, \"They're in the bathroom cabinet, next to the shampoo.\" The chick runs to the bathroom and grabs the medicine. As he's taking it, he looks at the frog and says, \"Thanks for reminding me, Froggy! I would have forgotten if it weren't for you!\" The frog smiles and says, \"No problem, Chickie! I'm just glad I could help.\" \ud83d\udc38\ud83d\udc24\ud83d\udc8a"}
