The next morning, the frog finds the chick in a panic.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" asks the frog.\n\n\"I forgot to take my medicine last night!\" cries the chick. \"I'm going to die!\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" says the frog. \"I'll hop to the pharmacy and get you some more.\"\n\nThe frog hops away, and the chick waits anxiously. Soon, the frog returns with a bottle of pills.\n\n\"Here you go,\" says the frog. \"One of these every night at 10 PM, and you'll be fine.\"\n\nThe chick takes the pills and thanks the frog. \"You're a lifesaver,\" says the chick. \"I don't know what I would have done without you.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" says the frog. \"I'm just glad I could help.\""}
