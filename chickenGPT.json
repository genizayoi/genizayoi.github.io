It's 10 PM!\" \ud83d\udc38 reminded diligently.\n\nBut the chick, lost in its thoughts, dismissed the reminder. The next morning, it woke up feeling groggy and miserable. \ud83d\udc38 hopped over, concerned: \"I think you forgot your \ud83d\udc8a last night, buddy!\" \ud83d\udc25 realized its mistake and promised to be more responsible. From then on, it never missed a dose, thanks to its vigilant froggy friend."}
